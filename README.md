## Hey there! 👋 I'm Sikiru, a Microsoft Technical support engineer and enthusiastic Microsoft Azure DevOps engineer using PHP Laravel | Docker | Git & GitHub Actions | Jenkins | Ansible | K8's | and Microsoft Azure DevOps!

As a Technical support engineer, I thrive on ensuring my customers are happy, put myself in their shoes, and resolve all that concerns the product for them. I have supported varieties of cloud applications in different sectors to make the life of users better. With over 3 years of hands-on experience, I've resolved, diagnosed, guided, troubleshoot, controlled, and direct over 5000 customers of over 5000 tickets or support queries, and built strong relationships between the organization and the customer.

With my love for Automation, currently leveraging DevOps tools to automate processes and speed up environment setup for developers, using Microsoft Azure DevOps, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, AWS x Azure, Nginx server, Linux, and GitHub Actions.

I have an in-depth background in liaising with end-users as a Microsoft Technical support Engineer where I relate bugs fixes, product feedback, troubleshooting, diagnosing, and providing resolution to apps issues, as this makes me a good fit in interacting, escalating or serving as a Middleman between the Developers and the Operations team, meaning, a DevOps engineer.

I am passionate about the work I do, but I am even more dedicated to cultivating a positive and efficient team environment.
