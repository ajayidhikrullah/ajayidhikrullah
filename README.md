## Hey there! 👋 I'm Sikiru, a Backend and DevOps engineer using PHP Laravel, Docker, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Ansible, K8's, and Microsoft Azure DevOps!

As a software and DevOps engineer, I thrive on creating data-driven cloud applications in different sectors to make the life of users better. With over 3 years of hands-on experience, I've used PHP Laravel to build web applications in the Transportation, Hospitality, and Estate management sector at both local and International levels, such as in the EMEA region, NOAM.

With my love for Automation, currently leveraging DevOps tools to automate processes and speed up environment setup for developers, using Microsoft Azure DevOps, Docker, Ansible, Jenkins, AWS x Azure, Nginx server, Linux, and GitHub Actions.

I have a background in liaising with end-users as a Microsoft Technical support Engineer where I relate bugs fixes, product feedback, troubleshooting, diagnosing, and providing resolution to apps issues, as this makes me a good fit in interacting or serving as a Middleman between the Developers and the Operations team, meaning, a DevOps engineer.

I am passionate about the work I do, but I am even more dedicated to cultivating a positive and efficient team environment.
